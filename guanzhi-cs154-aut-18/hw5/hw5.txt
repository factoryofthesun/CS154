1) 
	A) *pb
	B) If pb is a pointer to one of the array values 
	C) memory aliasing 
	D) just assign *pb to a local variable outside of the loop (e.g. int tmp = *pb) 
2) 
	A) One way system calls differ is that in order to access kernel services through a system call, the processors provide a special instruction "syscall n", which the user program executes to request service n. A second difference is that a system call runs in kernel mode, which accesses the kernel stack. A regular function call has instructions that access the same stack as the calling function. 
	B) The man command displays the system's reference manuals, which have the system calls and library functions predefined in seperate sections. 
	C) read: system call; read from a file descriptor 
		close: system call; close a file descriptor (type unsigned int)
		lseek: system call; read or write at a file offset 
		fork: system call; create a child process 
		alarm: library function; arranges for alarm signal to be delivered in input amount of seconds 
		sprintf: library function; produce output according to format and write to character string 
		pause: library function; causes calling process to pause until signal is delivered 
		brk: library function; changes location of program break
